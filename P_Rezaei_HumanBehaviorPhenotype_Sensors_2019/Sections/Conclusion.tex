%=================== Conclusion
In this paper, we have presented an AI assisted method for phenotyping human motor behavior from video recorded using a single RGB camera. Results demonstrate that the multi-stage method, which includes pose estimation, target tracking and action classification, provides accurate target-specific detection of activities in the presence of other human actors and is robust to changing environments.

The work presented herein focused on the classification of basic postures (sitting, standing and walking) and transitions (sitting-to-standing and standing-to-sitting), which commonly occur during the performance of many daily activities and are relevant to understanding the impact of diseases like Parkinson's disease and stroke on the functional ability of patients. This has laid the foundations for future research efforts that will be directed towards detecting and quantifying clinically meaningful information like detecting emergency events (e.g. falls, seizures) and assessing the severity of symptoms (e.g. gait impairments, tremor). Lastly, the code and models developed during this work will be released for the benefit of the broader research community.
